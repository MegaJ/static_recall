# Static Recall

Static Recall is a utility app for recalling the static (not-frequently-used) objects in your life. Let this application do the hard work of remembering where you last put your passport or the sweater your grandma knit you last holiday season. By taking a bit of time to enter basic information about an item and its location, it’s as simple as using our ‘Find It’ feature to quickly and efficiently locate your item(s). Happy Recall!

How To: Stash and Find Items
----------

To stash an item, you can either access the storage screen via the file icon on the home page or the plus button on the right
of the search bar in the 'Find It' activity. In the 'Stash It' activity, you can type in the name of the item, put it in a category for easier finding later, and use one of two options to indicate its actual storage location. You can type in that the “Shirt” is in the “Dresser” or you can take a picture of the item where you plan on keeping it. Just tap on the icon corresponding to your choice of input, and then you can press the ‘Add’ button to store the item’s information in the app’s file directory.

On the other hand, to find an item you can tap on the telescope icon on the home screen. Items can be viewed either in alphabetical order or by category, and you can switch between these views by tapping the three dots on the right side of the toolbar at the top of the screen. If you’re in a rush, you can also type an item’s name directly into the search field in the middle of the toolbar, and it should show up in the list view.

Once again, happy Recall!
